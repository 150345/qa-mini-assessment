This program parses test execution result lines and produces a summary
including pass/fail counts, per-test breakdown, invalid lines, and the
top failing test.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies

## How to Run the Program

1. Open a terminal
2. Run the main script:

```bash
python parser.py
Ensure the lines input is defined inside the script or passed as needed.

Ensure parser.py and test_parser.py are in the same directory

Run:
python -m unittest test_parser.py
This will execute all unit tests and report results.
